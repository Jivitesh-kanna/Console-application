# Voter Management System

## Overview

The Voter Management System is a console-based application developed in Java. It allows users to add new voter details, check existing voter details, and retrieve voter information using a 14-digit alphanumeric ID. The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to ensure modularity and maintainability.
